## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I recently learned from a different challenge that you could use

```css
#some-id[some-attribute];
```

as CSS selector but what I just learned is the you can also:

```css
#some-id: not([some-attribute]);
```

but you can go further byt adding a class:

```css
#some-id: not([some-attribute]) .some-class;
```

to be more specific styling an element.

I also got to learn about:

```JS
window.matchMedia("(min-width: 1130px)")
// &&
window.addEventListener("resize", syncAriaWithViewport);
// &&
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", syncAriaWithViewport);
```

and got to control attributes that way.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about speeding up the process, how to set up HTML while also thinking about accessibility. I also would like to learn more about what I should put and what I should not put so I won't excessively add too much attributes, since I heard that having the wrong or confusing ARIA is worse than not having them.
